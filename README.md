# Data Model and Autotyping for the DMX cooking show case

This plugin implements all topic types and association types needed for the cooking showcase used on the [DMX Demo Server](https://demo.dmx.systems) and in the webcast and in the [DMX Modeling Tutorial](https://vimeo.com/393512831)" (though slightly different here). It also provides autotyping for associations related to dish instances.

## Usage

Download the .jar file of dmx-biblio and dmx-cooking to the bunde-deploy folder of your DMX instance (also see the section on [Plugin Installation](https://dmx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin.html#plugin-installation) in the DMX Admin Documentation).

In DMX create an instance of the topic type "Dish", search for ingredients and create associations between them and the dish. The associations are automatically assigned the association type "Ingredient amount". Edit the associations to specify the quantities.
